# Data-Insights-into-Global-Road-Safety

The Road Accident Dataset is a comprehensive collection of data related to road accidents,
capturing key details such as accident causes, driver behaviour, environmental conditions,
and severity levels. With 5,001 recorded cases, this dataset serves as a valuable resource
for analyzing traffic safety trends, identifying high-risk factors, and proposing data-driven
strategies to minimize accidents and fatalities.

The dataset is structured with 30 attributes, covering aspects such as accident severity, the
number of injuries, vehicle conditions, weather conditions, and emergency response time, etc.
The availability of both categorical and numerical data makes it ideal for statistical analysis,
machine learning models, and predictive analytics in road safety research.

This dataset is called secondary data as we are using to find some insights which can help to
increase the surviving rate for the people.
